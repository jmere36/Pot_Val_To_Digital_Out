# Pot_Val_To_Digital_Out

Created By: Jmere36

Purpose: To read and change the output of a digital pin through a potentiometer or other sensors 

Has the feature of telling you what output is at and what specific value in the serial monitor

Been tested on an led (why the int is led) and seems very accurate

This can add many functionalities to your build including: using a potentiometer to control the loudness of your speakers
